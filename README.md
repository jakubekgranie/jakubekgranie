My real name's Jacob (shocker). I am an <b>young adult Polish CS student</b> with <b>plans of becoming a professional webmaster and desktop app creator.</b> Except for the obvious interests, I enjoy <i>philosophy (am a determinist)</i>, <i>botany</i>, <i>humanism</i>, <i>reading</i>, <i>pathology</i> and <i>self-development</i>. I also harbor thoughts about emigrating, albeit for the time being such plans are unexecutable.
