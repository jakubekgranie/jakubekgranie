<div>My real name's Jacob (shocker). I am an <b>adolescent Polish CS student</b> with <b>plans of attaining webmastery and desktop app creation proficiency.</b> Except for the obvious interests, I enjoy <i>philosophy</i> - especially <i>nihilism</i>, <i>objectivism</i> and <i>ontology</i>, <i>botany</i>, <i>humanism</i>, <i>reading</i>, <i>pathology</i> and <i>self-development</i>. I also harbor thoughts about emigrating, albeit for the time being such plans are unexecutable.

<h2 align="center">✧ >> What's new and what's not!</h2>
I am currently <b>working on my very own webisite - <a href="https://shatterwares.com">shatterwares.com</a>.</b> It's a hobby project I've been cultivating since ~last February. The work enables me to learn many new things and explore horizons I would've never in the natural environment of mine (school). Future <b>plans associated include adding a project hub, a pastebin-ish utility (least priority due to server-side language limitations)</b>, and maybe a blog if I'll care enough. I <b>love critique</b>, so if you want to lmk what should be this and that, <b>hmu on Discord!</b>
